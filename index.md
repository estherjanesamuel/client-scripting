> **Note**: To complete these exercises, you will need a [Microsoft Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) in which you have sufficient permissions to create and configure the required resources.

If a more complex setup is required, create a separate markdown file with setup instructions at \Instructions\Labs\00-setup.md - being sure to include "lab.title"" metadata at the top so it shows up the list below
-->

{% assign labs = site.pages | where_exp:"page", "page.url contains '/Instructions/Labs'" %}
{% for activity in labs  %}
- [{{ activity.lab.title }}]({{ site.github.url }}{{ activity.url }})
{% endfor %}
